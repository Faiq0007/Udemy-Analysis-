# Udemy Data Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing the pricing and subscription data of Udemy courses across four different subjects (Web Development, Musical Instruments, Graphic Design, and Business Finance). The goal is to identify trends and patterns to inform business decisions, such as where to create more courses and how to target marketing strategies to increase company revenue.

## Project Description
The primary objectives of this analysis are:
- **Identify demand**: Determine which subjects require more course creation based on student demand and engagement.
- **Analyze variations**: Examine the differences in average content duration, price, and student enrollment across subjects.
- **Course type analysis**: Evaluate the number of free vs. paid courses in each subject.
- **Pricing evaluation**: Determine the average pricing of web development courses at different levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
- **Popular courses analysis**: Identify the 20 most popular courses, including their level, pricing (free or paid), and content duration.
- **Impact of content duration**: Assess whether content duration influences course pricing.

The tools used for this analysis are:
- **Excel**: For data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis.
- **Tableau**: For data visualization to uncover key insights and trends.

## Key Insights
